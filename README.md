Interface reconstruction of adhering droplets for distortion correction using glare points and deep learning (code)

by Maximilian Dreisbach (Institute of Fluid Mechanics (ISTM) - Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT))


This code allows the evalution and training of neural networks for spatio-temporal gas-liquid interface reconstruction in two-phase flows as presented 
in our article "	Interface reconstruction of adhering droplets for distortion correction using glare points and deep learning".

The datasets used in this work, as well as the weights of the neural networks trained for interface reconstruction on these datasets are available here: https://doi.org/10.35097/egqrfznmr9yp2s7f

If you have any questions regarding this code, please feel free to contact Maximilian Dreisbach (maximilian.dreisbach@kit.edu).
