Particle Detection by means of Neural Networks and Synthetic Training Data Refinement in Defocusing Particle Tracking Velocimetry (code)

by Maximilian Dreisbach (Institute of Fluid Mechanics (ISTM) - Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT))

This code allows the evalution and training of neural networks for spatio-temporal gas-liquid interface reconstruction in two-phase flows as presented 
in our article "Particle Detection by means of Neural Networks and Synthetic Training Data Refinement in Defocusing Particle Tracking Velocimetry".

The datasets used in this work, as well as the neural networks trained for particle detection on these datasets are available here: https://doi.org/10.5445/IR/1000146837

If you have any questions regarding this code, please feel free to contact Maximilian (maximilian.dreisbach@kit.edu).
